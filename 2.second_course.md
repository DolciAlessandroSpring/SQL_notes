## INNER

Start with the most simple example.
```
SELECT *
FROM cities
  INNER JOIN countries
    ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
```

<br>

One can use the name of the tables already in the select.
```
SELECT c.code, c.name, c.region, p.year, p.fertility_rate
  FROM countries AS c
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    ON c.code = p.country_code
```
One can simply add N different joins one after another.

<br>

You can join on multiple columns, concatenating the logic
```
[ ... ]
ON A.col1 = B.col1 AND A.col2 = B.col2
```

<br>

## USING
There's a different way of writing the condition if the tables have the same name. Note the brackets.
```
SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS languages
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
USING (code)
```

<br>

## SELF JOIN
```
SELECT p1.country_code,
       p1.size AS size2010,
       p2.size AS size2015
FROM populations as p1
  INNER JOIN populations as p2
    ON p1.country_code = p2.country_code;
```

<br>

## CASE
Use it to create new columns with an `IF / ELSE` approach.
```
SELECT name, continent, surface_area,
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000
            THEN 'large'
       WHEN surface_area > 350000
            THEN 'medium'
       ELSE 'small' END
       AS geosize_group
FROM countries;
```
Note that all the `CASE` is basically a new column to select.


<br>

## INTO
It is possible to save a result of a query with a specific name. And use it in a different query.
```
SELECT country_code, size,
    CASE WHEN size > 50000000 THEN 'large'
        WHEN size > 1000000 THEN 'medium'
        ELSE 'small' END
        AS popsize_group
INTO pop_plus
FROM populations

-- different query
SELECT *
FROM pop_plus
```

<br>

## UNION (ALL)
It is possible to append two datasets, even if the columns have different names. The column name will be the first one.
If UNION ALL is used, then all the duplicates are kept.
```
SELECT country_code
  FROM cities
	UNION
SELECT code
  FROM currencies
```

## INTERSECT
Note that it works with >1 column.
```
SELECT code, year
  FROM economies
	INTERSECT
SELECT country_code, year
  FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;
```
